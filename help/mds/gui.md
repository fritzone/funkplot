## The **fũnkplot** GUI

We tried to make the **fũnkplot** gui as simple and easy to use as possible. Starting the application will greet you with the following screen:

![image-20221026141025284](/home/fld/work/p/geodraw/help/mds/imgs/first_steps_1.png)

On the top of the screen there is the toolbar with various buttons that by pressing will activate a specific functionality, as described below.

Below the toolbar is the programming area, with a tabbed interface, each program resides in its own tab page, and you can have several of these open.

Below the programming area there is the output window, here you will get feedback about the running program.

On the right of the screen there is the visualization area, which can be zoomed in using the mouse wheel, and by pressing and holding the mouse you can change the position of the coordinate system.

### The toolbar

The following is the main toolbar of the application:

The following functionality is hidden behind the icons:

| Icon                                                         | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <img src="/home/fld/work/p/geodraw/help/mds/imgs/gui_2.png" alt="image-20221101094108067" style="zoom:50%;" /> | Pressing this button will create a new program, and will add a new Tab page in the programs section. |
| <img src="/home/fld/work/p/geodraw/help/mds/imgs/gui_3.png" alt="image-20221101094710128" style="zoom:50%;" /> | Will open a **fũnkplot** program, with the extension `fnk` . |
| <img src="/home/fld/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20221101094836782.png" alt="image-20221101094836782" style="zoom:50%;" /> | Saves the current program to the disk. If the program was not saved before it will ask for a filename and location. The extension used for a **fũnkplot** program is `fnk`. |
| <img src="/home/fld/work/p/geodraw/help/mds/imgs/gui_5.png" alt="image-20221101095106872" style="zoom:50%;" /> | Saves the current program using a different name.            |
| <img src="/home/fld/work/p/geodraw/help/mds/imgs/gui_7.png" alt="image-20221101095216719" style="zoom:50%;" /> | Runs the currently selected program. The content of the plot area is cleared, the scene is set up using the settings from the current code and the code lines are interpreted then executed one after the other. |
| ![image-20221101095435122](/home/fld/work/p/geodraw/help/mds/imgs/gui_6.png) | Stops the execution of the currently running program. If a calculation takes a very long time, and you ran out of patience this is the button for you. |
| <img src="/home/fld/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20221101123615505.png" alt="image-20221101123615505" style="zoom:50%;" /> | This will export the current contents of the plot area’s viewport (ie: the image, after you have zoomed and positioned the drawing with the mouse) into a graphics file of your choice. |
| <img src="/home/fld/work/p/geodraw/help/mds/imgs/gui_9.png" alt="image-20221101123809317" style="zoom:50%;" /> | This will open the palette chooser window, from where you can copy the name of your favourite palette into the program. |
