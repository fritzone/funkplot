## The **let** keyword

The `let` keyword is used to make an assignment to a declared variable. Itâ€™s basic syntax is:

```matlab
let a = 1.2
```

This will assign the value `1.2` to the variable `a`, which was declared to be of type `number`. It will raise a syntax error to assign to a variable which was not declared, or if the type is different.

The following assignment assigns to the `point` type variable called `p` the point at `(1,1)`
