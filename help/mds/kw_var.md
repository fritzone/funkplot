## The **var** keyword

The `var` keyword is used to declare variables that later can be used to perform various operations with. The syntax is

```
var a b c number
```

This will declare`a`, `b` and `c` to be numeric variables. In order for proper behaviour you have to initializer the variables and then you can use them in operations later on.

The following variable types are recognized in **f≈©nkplot**.

- `number`
- `point`
- `list of numbers`. Please note the plural form of `number`.
- `list of points`. Please note the plural form of `point`.

For easier readability it is recommended that you organize your variables by type like in the example below:

```
var a b c d i number
var p1 p2 p3 point
var l1 l2 list of numbers
var ps1 ps2 list of points
```
